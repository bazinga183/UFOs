# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to create a website to house data for UFO sightings all across North America in the form of a hugh data table. In addition, this website also needed filters so that users could quickly access the data they needed quickly. For this project, I used JavaScript and HTML to format and create the functions that would ensure the website be functional. 

## Results

Upon arriving to the website's interface, users will be greeted to a visually stunning display where the opening headers and paragraphs are neatly organized and easy to navigate.

Below this, on the right is a table of all sightings within North America, and on the left is the filter system that users can use to sift through the data.

There are 5 different filters that can be used to ID different results: date, city, state, country, and shape of the sighting. The way using this filter works is that the user will first input the filter they desire, and then they will hit Enter and the website will turn up new results based on the criteria. For example, let's say the user wants only New Years sighting, they would input 1/10/2010, hit Enter, and it would filter for this date only.

Next, let's say I only want sightings from California, I would use the abbreviation "ca" for the next result and hit Enter.

Now, I want to condense the data to include sighting from only El Cajon, I follow the same procedure as above:

Finally, let us say that  only want triangle shaped sightings, I input "triangle" and hit Enter for the following results:

Here, I have only two results left, but the user is definitely happy with how easy it is to use this filter system. The best part is that the user does not have to hit enter after inputting a new filter for each category, but they can load each input and hit enter at the end to save some seconds.

## Summary
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
Overall, this website is rather limited in its scope, it does not have very complex design and while it is simple in getting the job done, perhaps some nuance can be added to make the process a little more fun or enjoyful for the user. For one, the cities, countries, and states are not capitalized and so the data formatting looks slightly juvenile when the results pop up and even some comments have errors in spelling or random captalization. 

Recommendations would include:
  - Fixing the capitalization on the website so that the data looks professional when the results pop up.
  - Allowing the filter to work as the inputs are being typed so that the new results pop up as the user finishes typing in their inputs. 

These results are mostly so that more viewers would attach a higher level of credibility and professionalism to this website!
